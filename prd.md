| FR-01              | Ingest contracts in PDF, DOCX, and scanned formats using OCR.   | As a user, I want to upload contracts in any format, including scans, so they can be processed automatically.         | System accepts and extracts text from various formats using OCR tools like Tesseract or Textract. |
| FR-02              | Classify contracts by type (e.g., NDA, MSA) using ML or LLM.    | As a user, I want the system to identify the type of contract I upload so that downstream processing is accurate.     | Contracts are accurately labeled with type using a classifier or zero-shot LLM.                   |
| FR-03              | Extract clauses, obligations, named entities from contracts.    | As a legal reviewer, I want the system to extract clauses and parties' obligations so I can quickly assess key terms. | System extracts entities, obligations, and clauses, linking each to its original text span.       |
| FR-04              | Map obligations to responsible parties.                         | As a user, I want to see who is responsible for what in a contract.                                                   | Obligations are linked to corresponding parties with labeled action items.                        |
| FR-05              | Provide explainability for extracted results.                   | As a legal user, I want to verify extractions against source text.                                                    | Each result is linked to its original location in the document for auditability.                  |
| FR-06              | Assign risk scores to clauses using predefined risk categories. | As a compliance officer, I want to identify high-risk clauses across contracts.                                       | Risk Agent flags and scores relevant clauses based on risk taxonomy.                              |
| FR-07              | Use RLHF to refine risk scoring based on user feedback.         | As a legal reviewer, I want the system to learn from my edits so it improves over time.                               | System incorporates legal feedback into future risk assessments dynamically.                      |
| FR-08              | Learn from compliance issues to refine risk policies.           | As an admin, I want the system to improve based on historical dispute data.                                           | Risk scores adjust over time based on outcomes like disputes or penalties.                        |
| FR-09              | Flag non-standard clauses and missing required language.        | As a legal team member, I want to be alerted to deviations from templates.                                            | System flags deviations from standard templates or missing regulatory clauses.                    |
| FR-10              | Notify stakeholders when legal red flags are present.           | As a stakeholder, I want to be alerted if a contract has compliance issues.                                           | Alerts are triggered for critical issues such as missing GDPR data clauses.                       |
| FR-11              | Provide a customizable dashboard showing contract KPIs.         | As an executive, I want to monitor contract health via a dashboard.                                                   | Dashboard displays KPIs, trends, and alerts, customizable by time, unit, type.                    |

| FR-13              | Use LangGraph to orchestrate agent workflows.                   | As a developer, I want agents to run autonomously but in a coordinated flow.                                          | Workflow execution is controlled via LangGraph, triggering agents in sequence.                    |
| FR-14              | Integrate with DocuSign, Salesforce, and ServiceNow.            | As an admin, I want contract data to flow between our existing tools and this system.                                 | Contracts and metadata sync bidirectionally with supported enterprise platforms.                  |
| TR-01              | Integrate LLMs using LangChain with fallback strategies.        | As a dev, I want model fallback to ensure reliable and cost-effective performance.                                    | LangChain connects GPT-4 and LLaMA with intelligent routing based on task precision.              |
| TR-02              | Implement hybrid vector + keyword search via FAISS/Weaviate.    | As a user, I want accurate clause retrieval using both meaning and exact terms.                                       | Semantic and keyword retrieval are combined for better clause matching.                           |
| TR-03              | Collect and persist legal feedback for RLHF.                    | As a legal team, we want our feedback to guide model behavior long-term.                                              | Feedback is stored for both real-time adaptation and batch RLHF tuning.                           |
| TR-04              | Build frontend in Streamlit (proto) and FastAPI+React (prod).   | As a user, I want an intuitive UI to upload and review contracts.                                                     | UI supports uploads, extraction visualization, risk feedback, and agent status.                   |
| TR-05              | Support clause validation and feedback in UI.                   | As a legal user, I want to validate or override extracted clauses easily.                                             | UI enables in-place edits or comments on extractions and risk flags.                              |
| TR-06              | Encrypt documents at rest and in transit.                       | As an IT admin, I want data to be secure at all stages.                                                               | Data is protected using AES-256 and HTTPS encryption.                                             |
| TR-07              | Implement RBAC for feature access.                              | As an org admin, I want to restrict access to sensitive features.                                                     | Users have role-based permissions for viewer, approver, or admin roles.                           |
| TR-08              | Mask or anonymize sensitive data in logs.                       | As a privacy officer, I want logs to avoid exposing private data.                                                     | Logs redact or mask sensitive fields while retaining traceability.                                |
| NFR-01             | Handle 1000+ contracts in batch with concurrent processing.     | As an enterprise user, I want to process large contract volumes efficiently.                                          | System supports parallel ingestion with performance maintained under load.                        |
| NFR-02             | Extraction + risk scoring latency < 10 seconds/document.        | As a user, I want near-instant processing of individual contracts.                                                    | Average latency per document remains under 10 seconds.                                            |
| NFR-03             | Resilient agent architecture; failure in one doesnâ€™t halt all.  | As an admin, I want the system to remain functional even if one module fails.                                         | Errors are contained to failed agents; others continue processing.                                |
